# prometheus-example

This project contains some sample code to expose internal data of a java application to https://prometheus.io/[prometheus].

## build & run

Just type

[source,shell]
----
./gradlew run
----

This starts link:src/main/java/org/example/SampleService.java[SampleService.java] which runs indefinitely.
Every 3 secs it picks another random number from 0 to 100 and prints it.
That value will also be exposed to prometheus
via a http server on port 1234. In a real life scenario that port will be pulled from a prometheus server actively.

There's also code for using https://github.com/prometheus/pushgateway/blob/master/README.md[Prometheus pushgateway].

NOTE: pushgatway code is commented out by default
